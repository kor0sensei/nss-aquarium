                        <p>Harvest Location: They are found within the central drainages of the United States. HABITAT: Adult channel catfish inhabit rivers and streams. They prefer clean, well oxygenated waters, but can also live in ponds and reservoirs.</p>

                <h1>Tank Cleaning Tips</h1>
                <div class="tank-tip">
                    <h3>How Often Do I Clean My Tank</h3>
                    <div class="tip">
                    <p>Exactly how often you need to clean your tank will depend on a number of factors including the size of your aquarium, and the number of fish, type of fish and the filter system that you have. However, there is a general schedule of cleaning activities that it would be beneficial to follow.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="tip">
                    <p>Daily: There should be no need to clean your tank daily, but there are some observations that you can make that will help you to understand if your tank is being cleaned often enough to keep your fish healthy. Just watch them for a few moments to make sure that they are behaving normally and aren’t gasping for air or seem sluggish. If they do then you may need to do another partial water change, regardless of how long it has been since the last one.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="tip">
                    <p>Every 6 months: Twice per year you should complete a deep clean of your tank and all associated equipment. This means unplugging everything and checking it all out to make sure it is in good condition, including filters, pumps, lights and more. Make sure you replace anything that is broken or in poor condition, and use your tools to help remove dust, dirt and more.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="tip">
                    <p>Weekly: If you have a particularly large tank then you may be able to get away with water changes slightly less often, but for most average-sized tanks, a weekly water change can be extremely beneficial to the health and wellbeing of your fish. To do this you should remove approximately one quarter of the volume of water in the tank, and replace it with treated water. You can use a scraper or sponge to clean off any decorative items that you have in the tank, and use your aquarium vacuum to give the gravel a good clean and remove any dirt and debris.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="tip">
                    <p>Monthly: It is important to keep an eye on the levels of ammonia, nitrate and pH levels within your tank and testing them once a month should be sufficient. Ideally they should be pretty steady from month to month, so keep a record somewhere safe so you have something to compare your readings to. Some indications of problems with the condition of your water can include cloudiness, a change in color, or if your fish are behaving abnormally. You should also clean your filter cartridges once a month.</p>
